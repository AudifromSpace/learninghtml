 I am going to talk about a few steps on How do we make the world a better place?
1. Erasing poverty-
Poverty is a big factor in the dragging back of the world. Poor people struggle with obtaining everyday supplies like food and water that well to-do families can easily get. We can eradicate poverty by donating food or money to charities or to poor people to help them.
2. Recycling-
Recycling is one of the easiest ways we can make this world a better place. By recycling we can make good use of the waste that we normally throw away. It's a good way to not throw away plastic which is harmful to soil.
3. Help animals-
We as Humans are the dominant creatures on planet earth. What about our other animal friends? Many animals cannot protect themselves from other animals or us humans. It's a good idea to adopt pets instead of buying them from breeders, and also stop buying products which are tested on animals. We can also donate to animal protection or treatment organizations.
4. Rascism-
Rascism is a big problem in the current world. Rascism means the discrimination of people of different human characteristics than other people and often treated as inferiors. Without rascism many people will get new job oppurtunities which increases the orld's economy and also makes the world more peaceful.
5. Being helpful to everyone-
Sometimes it feels good to help others and make their  day better. It's as simple as giving up your seat in a  public vehice to a disabled or old person. Helping others is the right thing to do and helps make the world a better place.
